This project illustrates a basic approach for solving the problem: how
do you detect when the user has closed a web page? Perhaps you want to
maintain some kind of interactive session, and have the server side
automatically close down when the user closes the page or navigates
away from your application, without having to require an explicit
invocation of some logout/shutdown function.

This can be done quite easily, by having the page keep a WebSocket
connection open. The browser will automatically close this connection
when the page is closed, and your server will be notified of that
immediately.
